## Intended use

### Primary intended uses
Supervised models intended for use within a telephone company. For the prediction of customers who left the company.
Non-Supervised models intended for use to see hidden patterns through variables.

### Primary intended users
For the workers of the telephone company.

### Out-of-scope use cases
It is not intended to be used for professional or non-curiosity purposes.


### Factors
Model only applicable for the company's customers. It will not work equally well for other companies.


## Metrics
The F1 Score for predicting customers who churned is around 80% for SVM models.


## Evaluation data
Dataset used: "telecom_customer_churn"
Removed "Latitude", "Longitude", "Monthly Revenue" and "City" variables.
All continuous data were normalized.
Some variables were grouped. 
Some methods were applied to avoid unbalanced labels.



## Quantitative analyses
Medium-high fiability model, F1 Score of 80% for SVM models.
